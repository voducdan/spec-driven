## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🎯 Portfolio Application (`/portfolio-app/`)
An interactive portfolio website built with modern web technologies, featuring:

- **Airflow-inspired DAG Visualization**: Portfolio data presented as task dependencies
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Professional UI**: Glass morphism effects, gradient backgrounds, animations
- **Task Status Display**: Real-time statistics and progress tracking
- **Interactive Canvas**: Zoom, pan, and explore portfolio sections

**Tech Stack:**
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Vite for development and building
- CSS3 with modern features
- Airflow-inspired design system

### 🏗️ Spec-Driven Framework (`/templates/`, `/scripts/`)
A systematic approach to software development using:

- **Feature Specifications**: Structured planning templates
- **Constitution-Based Development**: Quality gates and principles
- **Automated Workflows**: Scripts for project setup and management
- **Documentation Standards**: Consistent project documentation

## 🛠️ Development

### Portfolio App
```bash
cd portfolio-app
npm install
npm run dev     # Development server
npm run build   # Production build
npm run preview # Preview build
```

### Framework Usage
```bash
# Create new feature specification
./scripts/create-new-feature.sh feature-name

# Setup project plan
./scripts/setup-plan.sh
```
