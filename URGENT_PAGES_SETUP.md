# 🚨 URGENT: Manual GitHub Pages Setup Required

## The Problem
You're getting this error because GitHub Pages requires **manual activation** in repository settings. The workflow cannot automatically enable Pages due to permission restrictions.

## ✅ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION (Takes 2 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages Manually
1. **Go to your repository on GitHub**
   - URL: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spec-driven`

2. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Click the **Settings** tab (top of repository)
   - Scroll down to find **Pages** in the left sidebar

3. **Configure Pages Source**
   - Under **Source**: Select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - **Important**: Do NOT select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Click **Save**

4. **Verify Repository is Public**
   - Repository must be **Public** for free GitHub Pages
   - Check repository visibility in Settings → General

### Step 2: Re-run the Workflow
1. **Go to Actions Tab**
   - Click **Actions** tab in your repository
   - Find the failed workflow run

2. **Re-run the Job**
   - Click on the failed run
   - Click **"Re-run all jobs"** button
   - Workflow should now succeed

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- First deployment takes 5-10 minutes
- Check **Actions** tab for progress
- Portfolio will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/spec-driven/`

## 🔍 Visual Guide

```
GitHub Repository → Settings Tab → Pages (sidebar) → Source: GitHub Actions → Save
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### "Resource not accessible" Error
- **Cause**: Pages not manually enabled
- **Fix**: Follow Step 1 above

### Repository Must Be Public
- **Check**: Settings → General → Repository visibility
- **Fix**: Change to Public if currently Private

### Wrong Source Selected
- **Check**: Pages settings show "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from branch")
- **Fix**: Change source to "GitHub Actions"

## 🎯 Expected Results

After manual setup:
- ✅ Workflow completes without errors
- ✅ Portfolio builds and deploys automatically
- ✅ Live site at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/spec-driven/`
- ✅ Future pushes auto-deploy

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check workflow logs** in Actions tab for specific errors
2. **Verify all steps** above were completed exactly
3. **Wait 10 minutes** for GitHub's systems to sync
4. **Try re-running** the workflow again

---

**This is a one-time setup!** Once Pages is manually enabled, all future deployments will be automatic. 🚀
